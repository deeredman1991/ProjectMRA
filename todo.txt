General Notes:
	-Employers and Employees may dispute bad ratings where the onus will fall on the rater
		to prove their involvment with the rated party or the rating will be revoked.
		If the disputed rating is proven to be valid; the party filing the dispute will 
		recieve a warning and a mark against their account. If the disputed rating is not proven
		to be valid the rating will be removed and the rating party will recieve a mark against
		their account. Too many marks for giving invalid ratings will result in losing your 
		ability to rate and too many marks for disputing valid ratings will result in a loss
		of your ability to dispute ratings.

	-Don't forget to run a compression algorithm on all images and videos uploaded by users as well as limit file sizes.
		-Consider only allowing Premium Tier academies to upload videos to their lesson but allow the Free Tier to use YouTube.
